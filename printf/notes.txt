we gotta redo printf.

I'll not use libft, maybe try making a new library just to redo some functions
overall it should not use that many functions. I'll make a new Makefile as well

first of all is create my Makefile I guess

you'll have to change your put functions so they can return a number, apparently printf
also returns a number besides writing on screen... ehe
